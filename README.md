Looping Louie upgrade instructions using an arduino and light barriers

Functions: - Motor contorol of game (gets randomly faster and slower) 
           - Light barrier for each player
           - Integration of a players light, turns off when player lost all lives 

Parts list: 
  - 9V battery block 
  - 9V battery clip 
  - Voltage regulator 7805
  - 4 IR LEDs 
  - 4 IR phototransistor (e.g. QSD123)
  - 4 LEDs (blue, red, green, yellow)
  - 1 NPN transistor 
  - 2 Zenerdiode 
  - 1 Switch three with three connectors 
  - 6 100 立 Resistors 
  - 2 200 立 Resistors 
  - 1 1k 立 Resistor 
  - 1 10k 立 Resistor 
  - 1 Arduino Mega/Uno 
  - Cables 
  - Looping Louie game

Note: The motor icon here is a stand in icon for the battery pack of the game. 
The IR-Sensor and IR phototransistor are located on each side of the slide and a small hole was drilled to create an opening. 
The players led are located under the hammer of each player.  


More Ideas to implement: - LCD indicator for players live 
                         - Random stops during the game
